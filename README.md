# CubeSat Project

A sophisticated web-based interface for simulating and monitoring CubeSat satellite systems. This project provides an educational platform for understanding satellite technology and space systems through an interactive web interface.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time data collection and analysis
- Advanced wireless communication system
- Environmental monitoring capabilities
- Integrated sensor array for precise measurements
- Interactive LED visualization system
- Responsive and modern web interface

## 🛠️ Core Components

The project integrates several key hardware components:

- **ESP32**: Main processor for data acquisition and wireless transmission
- **Arduino Mega**: Secondary processor for LED visualization and data reception
- **BMP280**: High-precision environmental sensor
- **MPU6050**: 6-axis motion tracking device
- **NEO-6M GPS**: High-performance positioning module
- **ESP32-CAM Module**: Wi-Fi-enabled camera module

## 🚀 Operations

The system operates through three main processes:

1. **Data Collection**: Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters and satellite orientation
2. **Wireless Transmission**: Secure data transmission and remote command reception
3. **LED Visualization**: Real-time status updates and system diagnostics
